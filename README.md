Task Management Application

A great project to enhance your Java development skills is to create a **Task Management Application**. This project will help you practice various concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, file handling, and possibly even GUI development if you choose to implement a graphical interface.

## Project Overview

The Task Management Application will allow users to create, update, delete, and view tasks. Each task can have attributes like title, description, due date, and status (e.g., pending, completed).

### Key Features

1. **User Authentication**: Allow users to register and log in.
2. **Task CRUD Operations**: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for tasks.
3. **Task Categories**: Allow users to categorize tasks (e.g., Work, Personal).
4. **Due Dates**: Enable users to set due dates for tasks and sort tasks by due date.
5. **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search for tasks by title or category.
6. **Data Persistence**: Store tasks in a file or a database to retain data between sessions.

### Technologies to Use

- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **JavaFX or Swing**: For GUI development (optional).
- **JDBC**: If you choose to use a database (like MySQL or SQLite).
- **File I/O**: For saving and loading tasks if you opt for file storage.

### Steps to Get Started

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**: Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
2. **Design the Application**: Create a simple UML diagram to outline the classes and their relationships.
3. **Implement User Authentication**: Start with a simple console-based login system.
4. **Create Task Class**: Define a class for tasks with attributes and methods.
5. **Implement CRUD Operations**: Write methods to handle task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.
6. **Add Data Persistence**: Choose between file storage or a database and implement the necessary logic.
7. **Build the User Interface**: If using JavaFX or Swing, design the UI to interact with your application.
8. **Test Your Application**: Ensure all features work as expected and fix any bugs.

### Additional Enhancements

- **Notifications**: Implement reminders for tasks that are due soon.
- **User Interface Improvements**: Make the UI more user-friendly and visually appealing.
- **Mobile Version**: Consider creating a mobile version using Java for Android.

This project will not only solidify your Java skills but also give you a tangible product to showcase in your portfolio. Would you like more details on any specific part of this project?
